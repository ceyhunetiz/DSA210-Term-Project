How does screen time affect physical activity/performance? 

Project Overview

Over the next three months, I will analyze smartphone screen time and physical activity levels using data from an Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) and iPhone Screen Time reports. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, I aim to determine whether increased screen time correlates with decreased physical activity and how external factors like sleep and stress levels influence this relationship. This project will involve data collection, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling.

Motivation

With the increasing prevalence of smartphones, understanding how screen time affects physical activity is crucial. I have always been interested in health and fitness, and analyzing how my own screen time habits influence my activity levels will provide valuable insights. Additionally, this project will help me develop practical data science skills by applying real-world data to predictive analysis.

Objectives

Analyze Key Behavioral Factors: Identify the relationship between screen time, physical activity, and other daily habits.

Feature Selection & Engineering: Determine the most influential variables and create additional features that improve correlation analysis.

Develop and Evaluate Models: Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to explore trends and potential predictive relationships.

Dataset

The dataset consists of personal screen time records, fitness data, and contextual factors. Data will be collected from the following sources:

Apple Health & Screen Time Reports: Provides daily logs of phone usage, steps, and workouts.

Self-Reported Metrics: Daily stress and energy levels.

Weather Data (Optional): External conditions that may affect activity levels.

Data Analysis Plan

Data Collection & Cleaning

Automate data export from Apple Health & iPhone Screen Time.

Handle missing values and ensure consistent data logging.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyze correlations between different variables and activity levels.

Compare trends over time for screen time vs. physical activity.

Investigate the impact of external factors like sleep and weather.

Feature Engineering

Create rolling averages for screen time and activity levels over a week.

Categorize screen time usage (social media, video, fitness apps, etc.).

Develop stress and energy impact ratings.

Predictive Modeling

Use regression analysis and clustering to identify behavior patterns.

Compare predictions against actual results to determine significant correlations.

Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant relationship between screen time and physical activity levels.

Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): There is a significant relationship between screen time and physical activity, with increased screen time associated with lower activity levels.
